A Chinese Common Char Finite Field Encryption Package in Python


**update:**
since Jan 2019 I'm start slow working on:

- going to change xxtea-python implementation, a newer one
- going to port to java and have a android mobile app, repo: ganben/hanencrypt
- improve the 6bit to 8bit transform problem, by add a fixed interval half byte
